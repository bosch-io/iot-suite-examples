# File Upload by device
This example shows how to enable a device to upload files to an AWS S3 Bucket without the need of the device to know about AWS.
The device authentication is guaranteed by the Bosch IoT Hub and all the device needs to know about the S3 bucket is a pre-signed URL which is provided by a generic command that is sent to the device.
